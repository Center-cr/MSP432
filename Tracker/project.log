		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '--float_support=FPv4SPD16 -mv7M4' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16'

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '-mv7M4' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-march=thumbv7em -mcpu=cortex-m4'

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '--endian=little' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-mlittle-endian'

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '--code_state=16' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-mthumb'

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '-Ooff' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-O0'
			tiarmclang's -O0 option disables optimization

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting: 
				--include_path="${CCS_BASE_ROOT}/arm/include" --include_path="${CCS_BASE_ROOT}/arm/include/CMSIS" --include_path="${PROJECT_ROOT}" --include_path="${CG_TOOL_ROOT}/include" 
			has been migrated to target-tool setting: 
				-I"${CCS_BASE_ROOT}/arm/include" -I"${CCS_BASE_ROOT}/arm/include/CMSIS" -I"${PROJECT_ROOT}" -I"${CG_TOOL_ROOT}/include"

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '--define=__MSP432P401R__ --define=ccs' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-D__MSP432P401R__ -Dccs'

		!NOTE: Source-tool setting '-g' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-gdwarf-3'

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '--wchar_t=16' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-fno-short-wchar'
			tiarmclang does not support 16-bit wchar_t in its runtime libraries; the --wchar_t=16 option will map to tiarmclang's -fno-short-wchar option (32-bit wchar_t type assumed)

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '--common=on' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-fcommon'

		!WARNING: Source-tool setting '--advice:power=all' cannot be migrated
			tiarmclang does not support checking of ULP power rules; --advice:power option will not be migrated

		!NOTE: Source-tool default '' has been migrated to target-tool setting '-Werror=ti-pragmas -Werror=ti-macros -Werror=ti-intrinsics'
			use of legacy TI pragmas will be flagged as errors
			use of legacy TI pre-defined macro symbols will be flagged as errors
			use of legacy TI intrinsics will be flagged as errors

		!WARNING: The following source-tool settings were not migrated because no migration rules have been defined - please migrate these settings manually, if applicable: 
				--gcc --diag_warning=225 --diag_wrap=off --display_error_number
